The following is my non-exhaustive list of recommendations.

## Table of contents

## Philosophy

I never finished any philosophy books because I find them hard to read (lengthy and boring to be honest). However, I do believe conclusions from philosophers are useful to help me understand big problems.

- [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus)

  In general, I agree with Absurdism that the universe is meaningless. We should accept the meaninglessness of existence and find joy in our daily lives.

- [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus)

  I read the Chinese version. Cannot comprehend. Interesting way of presenting arguments.

  > Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

- [Nutrition Made Simple!](https://www.youtube.com/@NutritionMadeSimple)

  Nutrition has a lot of nuances, and I cannot find any "best" diet, but in general whole foods are good, avoid highly processed food and high-sodium food.

- [Bryan Johnson](https://www.bryanjohnson.com/)

  - a rich dude who doesn't wanna die
  - credible data-driven approach, lack-of-evidence approaches, be skeptical.

- [Physionic](https://www.youtube.com/@Physionic), YouTube channel, paper reading, evidence presenting.
