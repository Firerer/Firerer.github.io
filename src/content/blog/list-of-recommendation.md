The following is my non-exhaustive list of recommendations.

## Table of contents

## Philosophy

I never finished any philosophy books because I find them hard to read (lengthy and boring to be honest). However, I do believe conclusions from philosophers are useful to help me understand big problems.

- [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus)

  In general, I agree with Absurdism that the universe is meaningless. We should accept the meaninglessness of existence and find joy in our daily lives.

- [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus)

  I read the Chinese version. Cannot comprehend. Interesting way of presenting arguments.

  > Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.

- [Philosophical Investigations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations)
