## Tech Stack

I have explored a fair number of different programming languages, including C, Rust, C#, Java/Kotlin, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Scheme, and Haskell, to name a few. Being a curious individual, I am naturally motivated to seek out various programming languages and technologies. They help me view problems from diverse perspectives and devise solutions that might be unknown to others.
